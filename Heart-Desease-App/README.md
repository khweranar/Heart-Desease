About the APP
This app enables users to enter their age, gender, cholesterol levels, and other pertinent details. Using this information, the app forecasts the user's risk of developing heart disease. The results are presented in an intuitive interface, with high-risk predictions highlighted in red and low-risk predictions in green. Additionally, the app offers guidance on understanding the results and encourages users to consult a healthcare professional if they have any concerns about their heart health.
